User Stories

User story 1 - a user goes to a small farm town known for its passion for school and university sports, and braais(barbecues). He arrives in the town with no one that he knows, and seems lost as he knows no one in the town. He would like to experience the best of what this little town has to offer, and although he feels there may be something interesting happening he has no idea how or where to find it. His sister suggests he try the Zkhiphani website… It ends up being a weekend of discovery and new experiences.


User Story: Reserving  a Getaway in Bloemfontein on Zkhiphani

A user intends to reserve a delightful escape in Bloemfontein, South Africa through the Zkhiphani website. The website should provide a seamless experience for the user to specify Bloemfontein as their destination. It should then display a range of lodging options, encompassing apartments, houses, and unique accommodations. Each listing should furnish comprehensive property details, encompassing photos, amenities, guest evaluations, and the host's profile. The user should have the ability to employ filters to refine their search based on factors like dates, guest count, budget, and specific amenities. Once the user discovers a lodging that captures their interest, they should be able to view the availability schedule and comprehend the complete cost of their stay. The website should ensure a secure and user-friendly reservation procedure, empowering the user to effortlessly select preferred dates, input guest details, and complete a payment.
